### Business Problem

Can we build a machine learning model to accurately predict salaries of the baseball player based on their seasonal and career statisctics?

### Dataset

* AtBat: Number of times at bat in 1986
* Hits: Number of hits in 1986
* HmRun: Number of home runs in 1986
* Runs: Number of runs in 1986

* CAtBat: Number of times at bat during his career
* CHits: Number of hits during his career
* CHmRun: Number of home runs during his career
* CRuns: Number of runs during his career
* CRBI: Number of runs batted in during his career
* CWalks: Number of walks during his career
* League: A factor with levels A and N indicating player's league at the end of 1986
* Division: A factor with levels E and W indicating player's division at the end of 1986
* PutOuts: Number of put outs in 1986
* Assists: Number of assists in 1986
* Errors: Number of errors in 1986
* Salary: 1987 annual salary on opening day in thousands of dollars
